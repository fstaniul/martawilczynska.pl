I graduated from the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin in 1994. 
In the years 1994–2005 I worked in the Department of General Surgery and the West Pomeranian Center for Burns Treatment and Plastic Surgery in Gryfice 
where I obtained the 1st and 2nd degree specialization and the title of specialist in general surgery.

From 2005 to 2012 I worked in a leading plastic surgery center in Poland at the Plastic Surgery Clinic in Polanica Zdrój.
Here I was educated under the watchful eye of Professor Kazimierz Kobus and Dr. Ireneusz Łątkowski. 
In 2010 I obtained the title of Specialist in Plastic Surgery under the supervision of Dr. Ireneusz Łątkowski.

I have been dealing with plastic surgery since 1999. I have gained experience in my specialty both in Poland and abroad.

I am a member of the Polish Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, the Association of Polish Surgeons, 
the Polish Society of Burn Treatment.
