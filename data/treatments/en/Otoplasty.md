# Otoplasty - ear pinning

The procedure is performed on patients with ears protruding on one side or on both sides (protruding pinna). It is performed under regional anesthesia with an intravenous administration of painkillers. The procedure consists of partial removal of the skin located near the posterior pinna, shaping and suturing cartilages with unabsorbable stitches and finally suturing the skin.

After the procedure a special pressure dressing is being used as ears tend to be swollen, red, sore and very sensitive to touch. Patient should take painkillers. Above mentioned symptoms will subside in the course of time.

The patient should wear a headband covering the ears during day and night (24 hours a day) for 1 month after the procedure. In the 2 and 3 month after the procedure the band could be worn only at night.
