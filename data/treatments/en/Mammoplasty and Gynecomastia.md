# Women (reduction mammoplasty)

Such procedures are performed on patients with big mammary glands due to aesthetic and health reasons. Breast reduction relieves the patient and corrects the shape of the glands. Procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Duration - 1,5 up to 2,5 hours.

The surgeon removes the excess skin, subcutaneous tissue and glandular parts and relocates the mammilla. Remaining tissues form the new shape of the breast.

Reduction surgeries are performed with the use of various incision types and techniques. Most commonly used technique implies an incision formed in the shape of a keyhole. Such an incision leaves a scar in the shape of an anchor. Other incisions may eliminate such extensive scarring but they are always picked by the surgeon according to individual features of the patient and according to the reduction scope.

After the procedure the patientâ€™s wound is dressed with a special surgical dressing in the form of a bra which shall be worn for 3 months after the procedure. For 3 weeks after the procedure patient should avoid extensive manual effort, especially activities engaging the movement of shoulders (for example hefting, lifting, raising arms). Patient can get back to work (if it does not require manual effort) in 2 weeks after the procedure.

# Men (gynecomastia surgery)

In case of men, the excess tissue around the chest area (breast) is made of components such as glandular tissue, connective tissue and fat tissue. The surgery is performed with the use of the liposuction technique and the reduction of the glandular and also partly of the connective tissue. The procedure starts with the liposuction followed by the removal of the hypertrophic gland with the adjoining connective tissue through the incisions made near the bottom line of the nipple areola. The patient should also test hormone levels in order to eliminate the possibility of endocrinological problems being the main cause of the deformity. Ultrasound scan could also be suggested.

The procedure is performed under general anesthesia or sedation. Duration - 1 hour.

For 3 months after the procedure the patient is supposed to wear a special pressure vest. During the 1 month the vest should be worn the whole time (24 hours a day), afterwards only during sleep.
