# Rhinoplasty (nose correction)

Procedures correcting the shape of the nose are dedicated to patients with post-traumatic or congenital defects causing deformities of nasal cartilages and/or nasal bones. The inner parts of the nose are often deformed (nasal septum, nasal concha) and thereby impair breathing. In such cases the procedure can both improve the air flow and also change the outer shape of the nose.

Depending on the type of deformity we can either make the nose look smaller by reducing particular nose parts or enlarge it by adding cartilage structures.

Procedures are performed under general anesthesia. The incision (based on the current state of knowledge) is made on the columella and becomes almost invisible in the course of time (no visible scars). After the procedure every patientsâ€™ nose is dressed in an adhesive bandage and plaster cast. Tampons are being placed inside the nose. After the procedure patient can feel the discomfort while breathing due to the swelling and the placement of tampons. Patient could observe swelling and bruising around the eyelid up to 1-2 weeks after the procedure.

After such procedures patients should avoid alcohol, manual effort, spicy dishes, hot drinks, bending over and situations effecting in rise of blood pressure. Getting back to work is usually possible after 2 weeks (only if the job does not involve manual effort, does not effect in constant rising of blood pressure and the patient is not exposed to dusting and reeking). Patients should avoid all extreme and contact sports for 6 months after the procedure.
