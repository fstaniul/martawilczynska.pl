# Breast augmentation

Procedure is performed on patients with small breasts, asymmetrical breasts and on women who lost the firmness of their mammary glands due to aging. Procedure is performed in general anesthesia. Standard duration - 1,5h.

Augmentation is performed with the use of silicone implants in various sizes and shapes, produced by various companies (MENTOR, Polytech). Implantation could be performed with the use of various incisions - just below the inframammary fold, on the dermo-epidermal and nipple-areola junction or in the armpit. Implants could be placed in three different locations - directly underneath the mammary gland, under the pectoral fascia and under the pectoral muscle. All those details and matters are discussed with the surgeon before the procedure. Thickness of the subcutaneous fat tissue is a crucial issue.

Size of the implant is chosen based on individual features of each patient and on the grounds of performed measurements.

Standard procedure starts with the incision of patientâ€™s skin and subcutaneous tissue followed by the preparation of the compartment for the implant and implantation of the previously chosen type of implant. The wound is being stitched up and drains are being left in the compartment surrounding the implant. Finally the wound is covered with a special surgical dressing in the form of a bra which shall be worn for 3 months after the procedure.

Swelling and individually intensified pain (possible to be relieved with painkillers) are both normal effects of the procedure - they will subside eventually in the course of time. Sometimes patients observe bruising, which is also a normal post-op effect. Nipples may be ultra sensitive to the touch and breasts may cramp periodically - both are also normal effects and will subside in the course of time. For 3 weeks after the procedure patient should avoid extensive manual effort, especially activities engaging the movement of shoulders (for example hefting, lifting, raising arms). Patient can get back to work (if it does not require manual effort) in 1-2 weeks after the procedure.
