# Aesthetic medicine

Aesthetic medicine procedures are performed in order to improve skin appearance and smooth or reduce existing wrinkles. Procedures could require using own fat, hyaluronic acid or botox, although not every patient could be administered the above mentioned substances. Suitable qualification is necessary in order to avoid worsening of the appearance because of excessively drooped eyebrows or lack of positive effect due to too deep wrinkles, which qualify for surgical intervention.
