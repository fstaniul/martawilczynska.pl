# Liposuction - lipoplasty

Liposuction is not a weight loss method. It is a procedure useful in shaping bodies covered in fatty deposits in the abdominal areas, hips, thighs, arms (shoulders) and in the back.

The procedure could be performed under various anesthesia types depending on the location of the operated body part. Lipoplasty is usually performed with the use of the suction pump, but a manual syringe could also be used. Both methods are effective in removing excess fatty deposits. Type of the medical equipment is chosen individually and depends on the extensiveness of suctioned areas. Only deeply located fat portions are being removed, whereas the subcutaneous fat tissue stays intact - it minimizes the possibility of development of facial irregularities.

After the procedure the patient is dressed in a special suit that minimizes the possibility of side effects and enables the skin to fit closely and constrict faster. The suit shall be worn for 3 months. Getting back to work is possible after 1-2 weeks (depending on the extensiveness of the procedure).
