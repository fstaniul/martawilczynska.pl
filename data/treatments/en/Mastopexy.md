# Mastopexy - raising of saggy breasts

The procedure is dedicated to patients, whose breasts became saggy after giving birth, breastfeeding or after an intensive weight loss period. The procedure could be combined with breast implantation.

The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Incision type is chosen individually and depends on the amount of the extra skin supposed to be removed, on size and firmness of the gland and also on whether the nipple and its areola shall be relocated. Usually the incision is similar as in the reduction mammoplasty and leaves a scar in the form of an anchor.

The patient shall wear a special surgical dressing in the form of a bra for 3 months after the procedure.
