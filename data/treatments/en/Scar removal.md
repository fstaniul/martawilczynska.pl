# Removal of skin blemishes and imperfections, scar removal

Removal of skin blemishes and imperfections is performed due to oncologic and aesthetic reasons. Removal of blemishes or papule is performed in such a way, that post-removal scarring is almost completely invisible. Such procedures are performed under regional anesthesia.

Scar removals or scar corrections are performed in case of presence of disfiguring and defacing scars within the whole area of skin surface. Particularly important is to remove or correct the scars that limit functions of particular body parts, such as cicatricial ectropion, scars restricting joint movements and the like. Smaller procedures are performed under regional anesthesia, whereas extensive under general or nerve block anesthesia. Corrections could be both local/small and extensive (requiring skin-graft).
