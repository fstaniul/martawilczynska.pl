# Blepharoplasty (eyelids correction)

Corrections of eyelids are performed both due to aesthetic and functional reasons.

In case of young patients the deformities usually show up in the form of swelling in the tear duct area. Correction is performed by applying a specially pre-prepared fat (a so called „nano fat”). The recuperation lasts 2 weeks and after this time the swelling and visible yellow pigmentation of the eyelids shall subside.

In case of older patients, the flaccidity of the skin in the upper eyelid area and drooping of the eyebrow area could be observed due to the aging processes. A drooping upper eyelid could sometimes even narrow the field of vision and put pressure on the ciliary margin, which effects in the irritation of cornea due to „curling” of eyelashes (trichoma). In the lower eyelids the so called „eye bags” show up and highlight the junction between the eyelid and the cheek. The atrophy and droopiness of the fat tissue in the buccal-zygomatic space effects in the lack of support for the orbital tissues and the atrophy of the fat tissue in the paracentral part of lower eyelid area, just beneath the eyebrow.

Foregoing approach consisted in the removal of all excessive skin, muscles and fat tissue through the outpouchings of the orbital septum. The incisions on the skin of the upper eyelid have been made in such a way, that scars from suturing would hide in laughter lines and natural skin folds. The incisions on the skin of the lower eyelid have been made right below the ciliary margin and scars have been hidden in the natural skin folds.

Current approach is way different. Skin incisions are made the same way as before, but the procedure is based mostly on the conservative resection of tissues. Only the skin is affected by the procedure - muscles and fat tissue usually stay intact, only in certain cases the fat tissue in the lower eyelid area may also be relocated. The procedure is focused on eyebrow lifting and filling in the fat tissue in the face areas mentioned above. Such an approach enables the surgeon to restore the young appearance without changing patient’s facial features.

After the procedure the patient could feel swelling and bruising, which would fade after 2 weeks. The vision may be a little bit blurry, especially after applying the ointment, and the palpebral fissure may not close completely due to the post-op swelling. After the procedure the patient should wear sunglasses when leaving home in order to protect the eyes from sun and wind. Patient can get back to work after 1 week. Remaining bruising could be covered with make-up.

The procedure is performed under regional anesthesia with or without intravenous infusion of painkillers. Duration - 1-2 hours.
