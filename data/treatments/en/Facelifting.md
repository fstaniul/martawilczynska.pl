# Browlift

Corrections of eyelids are performed both due to aesthetic and functional reasons.

In case of young patients the deformities usually show up in the form of swelling in the tear duct area. Correction is performed by applying a specially pre-prepared fat (a so called „nano fat”). The recuperation lasts 2 weeks and during this time the swelling and visible yellow pigmentation of the eyelids shall subside.

Aging processes cause attenuation of muscle fibers, loosening of junctions between them and atrophy of fat tissue under the orbucilaris oculi. Additionally, changes in shape of superciliary arch may occur - outer ⅓ may lower and droop. A visible junction between the cheek and eyelids shows up. All those processes effect in accumulation of loose skin on the upper eyelid and create an appearance of „eye bags” on the lower eyelid. A drooping upper eyelid could sometimes even narrow the field of vision and put pressure on the ciliary margin, which effects in the irritation of cornea due to the „curling” of eyelashes (trichoma) - in such cases a surgical procedure is an absolute necessity.

Foregoing approach consisted in the removal of excessive skin, muscles and fat tissue through the outpouchings of the orbital septum.

Current approach is based mostly on skin removal and minimizes tissue irritation. Intraorbital fat from the outpouchings of orbital septum of lower eyelids is used to fill in cavities developed due to aging processes. The incisions on the skin of the upper eyelid are made in such a way, that scars from suturing would hide in laughter lines and natural skin folds. The incisions on the skin of the lower eyelid are made right below the ciliary margin and scars hide in the natural skin folds. Such an approach enables the surgeon to restore the young appearance without changing patient’s facial features. If brow droopiness is clearly visible, an additional brow lift of ⅓ of the outer part is performed. Incisions are made on the brows, a part above them is removed and eyelid muscles are lifted up. Scars are hidden in the browline. Permanent make-up could also be used afterwards. Such a procedure is the safest and most effective in comparison to procedures involving incisions on the hair line or inside hairy areas of the skull.

After the procedure the patient could feel swelling and bruising, which would fade after 2 weeks. The vision may be a little bit blurry, especially after applying the ointment, and the palpebral fissure may not close completely due to the post-op swelling. After the procedure the patient should wear sunglasses when leaving home in order to protect the eyes from the sun and wind. Patient can get back to work after 1 week. Remaining bruising could be covered with make-up. Bruising should be protected from the sun in order to avoid discoloration.

The procedure is performed under regional anesthesia. Duration - around 30 min (only upper eyelids), around 2,5 h (upper and lower eyelids).

# Facelifting, Necklifting, Midfacelifting, Cheekbone implants

Those procedures are performed under general anesthesia. Their main aim is to remove the excess of flaccid skin and tighten flaccid face and neck muscles in order to achieve a younger appearance. Those procedures are dedicated to patients with drooping cheeks, „chubby” cheeks, highlighted nasopharyngeal fold and a flaccid neck.

Facelifting starts with tightening of the skin in the temporal area on the line of the hairy part of the skin around sideburns, followed by skin tightening of the frontal ear at the top of the antilobium and around the earlobe, completed with skin tightening around the area at the posterior of the ear and alongside posterior lines of hairy areas of the head. The surgeon dissects the skin from the face, from behind the ears and from the neck and separates it from deeply located tissues. Afterwards, the surgeon lifts the skin (SMAS lifting) together with the posterior line of the platysma muscle and makes sutures above the previous location of lifted parts - it effects in a better muscle tautness. Finally, the excess skin is removed and sutures are laid.

Necklifting is dedicated to patients with visible excess skin in the neck area. Incisions are the same as in facelifting and enable the surgeon to dissect the skin from the neck. Transverse incision of the platysma muscle is followed by its connection to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Midfacelifting is dedicated to patients with highlighted nasolabial folds and deformities of the midface (from the level of the eyes to the level of the corners of the mouth). Incisions are made on the lower eyelid (same as in the lower eyelid correction). Lower eyelid correction and midfacelifting could be combined in order to give a very satisfying filling effect due to the lifting of the drooped tissues to the area beneath the lower eyelid.

Both procedures could also be combined with additional cheekbone implantation.

In all cases a tissue adhesive glue is being used in order to close dissected tissues - it completely reduces the possibility of an occurrence of the most common complication in such procedures, namely haematoma.

After the procedure the patient may observe swelling and bruising - they will fade in the course of time. For 3 months the patient may experience disfunction of the skin sensation in the frontal turbinal area. The patient shall protect the skin from the UV light by using sunscreens in order to avoid permanent discoloration. Patient can usually get back to work after 2-3 weeks. Remaining bruising could be covered with make-up.
