# Labiaplasty - labia minora reduction

The procedure is performed on women with an excessively overdeveloped labia minora. It is performed under general or regional anesthesia with an intravenous administration of painkillers.

The procedure consists of the removal of mucosa and inner connective tissue so that after the procedure the labia minora would hide between the labia majora.

After the procedure the patient could suffer from temporary swelling and bruising. Sexual intercourses should be avoided for 6 weeks after the procedure.
